# uOttawa Library Proxy Redirect Bookmarklet

Library links to authenticated resources often don't work, or you access your them through another point of origin. This bookmarklet allows you to easily load the uOttawa library proxy version of the current page.

GitHub (sensibly) doesn't allow embedding JS. Copy the [code](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lchski/uo-library-redirect-bookmarklet/master/bookmarklet.js) into [a bookmarklet generator](http://mrcoles.com/bookmarklet/) and get the bookmarklet from there.
